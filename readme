1. Import the project in Eclipse IDE. 
2. Put the tbl-files into the folder named "tbl" so that the program can read them.
3. main() function is in cpp/main.cpp.
4. The newOrder and the dilivery transactions as well as the query is written as functions in operators/Operator.cpp.
5. Use the 'task' variable at the beginning of main() to switch between the tasks (only task 3, 4, 5)

7. User does not need a semicolon ";" at the end of query statements.
8. Toggle the variable 'bool useGenCode' to false or true in main.cpp to use the real or the generated code (task4).
