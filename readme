1. Create two folders named "tbl" and "bin" in root folder and put the *.tbl-files into the "tbl" folder so that the program can import the data.
2. Import the project in Eclipse IDE as New Makefile project to run it or use command " make && ./bin/main " to compile and run the program on linux shell.
3. main() function is in src/main.cpp.
4. The query that is parsed is stored in file '_task4_query.sql' in the root folder.
5. The generated code is in file 'TranslatedQuery.cpp' in the root folder and will be run automatically after created.
6. The programm is built and tested on Eclipse IDE neon.1 on Xubuntu 16.04 LTS.
